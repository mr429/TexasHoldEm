# TexasHoldEm
The next project coming from ChillHumanoid! follow along as I figure out how to make this work. 

## Plan
It's going to be a 9-player table(including you, the user) with various buy in amounts.(Fake) money prizes would begin at 4th place, and would vary depending on the buy-in. You'd be playing computers, and I currently have no interest in adding a multiplayer option. 

You would start out with x amount of cash(most likely 10k) which can be used to buy in to tournaments(fake ones, with computers). The tournaments would be like any other poker tournament. Try to be the last man standing. Experience would be given for winning hands, and getting 4 place or better.(fake) cash would be given upon leveling up, and at certain levels, you would unlock bigger blind tables(this is to be helpful to YOU, so you don't try to buy in to a tournament you can't afford to lose.) Note: once you are out of chips, you are out of chips. your poker carrier is done, and it is time to create a new profile. 

so what's the end goal? what are you trying to achieve? 
You want to win the Main Event tournament. 

## Dev Plan
I plan to work on this for 3-4 hours a day, monday-friday. However, I do have a normal job, and I do enjoy movies and television and sleep, so it will vary. I hope to have something playable, yet buggy, by the end of the week. It won't have all the features. but you'll be able to play in one 9 player tournament. It won't count towards your chip count and that will reset when i have profiles set up better. 

## Timeline
April 10th - Playable Version
End of April - Profiles and ability to win chips to your profile. as well as experience. 
End of May - Multiple tournament buy-ins.
End of August - As close to a full game as I can get. That is the point where I will be starting school again, and development will come to a slow stop. 

# So what is your role?
When I have new playable versions, play them. test them. Let me know what goes wrong. Where? how? 
The more information I have, the better the game can get. I will of course, also be doing play testing, and always will try to release bug-free playable versions.
